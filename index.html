                <p>
                    There’s nothing like a good night’s sleep to help you feel energized, focused, and refreshed. However, when you are caring for a senior loved one, quality sleep can be elusive—for both of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lack of quality sleep may make you both feel sluggish, distracted, anxious, sad, or irritable. Sleep deprivation can affect your immune system and can increase the risk of complications related to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Optimizing a sleep routine is key and starts with the following fundamentals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid long daytime naps when you can</li>
                    <li>Go to bed and rise on the same schedule daily, when possible</li>
                    <li>Shut off the TV and other devices an hour before bed and do a quiet activity, like reading a book or working on a puzzle</li>
                    <li>Start bathing, brushing teeth, and putting on pajamas at a set time of night</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Are Strategies to Help Seniors Get Better Sleep?</h3>
                <p>
                    Beyond the basics, you need to create a safe and comfortable sleep environment. Here are three effective strategies Visiting Angels <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/caregivers">caregivers</a> recommend to help get better ZZZs:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Make Clear Paths in the Bedroom</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Keep laundry and other items out of walkways. Remove hoses and cords—for device chargers, lamps, or CPAP, oxygen, or IV tubing—from the floor.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Keep pets in a crate to avoid tripping and slippery pet messes. A Visiting Angels caregiver can help <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/professional-home-care-can-help-seniors-with-pets/20857"><u>keep pathways clear of hazards</u></a> by putting away personal care items after helping your senior.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <li><b>Balance Sound, Light, and Warmth</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Ambient noise in the room can help induce sleep. Try a radio or white noise machine for soft sound without visual stimulation.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        During the day, spend time outdoors to realign the body’s built-in sleep and wake cycle. This also helps relieve <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/alzheimers-care-helping-to-manage-sundowners-syndrome/478"><u>symptoms of sundowning—agitation</u></a> that is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and happens in the afternoon or early evening. At bedtime, use blackout curtains to darken the room, but keep nightlights on to illuminate paths to the bathroom and bedroom door.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Choose warmer pajamas instead of extra blankets that can be kicked off in the night and become a tripping hazard. Some like to sleep with a fan on—talk with a doctor about whether this is OK due to dry eye or other health conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">

                    </p>
                    <li><b>Be Mindful About Beverages</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Hydration is important, but getting up for a glass of water at night can result in spills and falls. Set a water bottle with an easily accessible spout—not an open glass or cup—on a bedside table for nighttime sipping.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Getting up frequently to use the restroom at night introduces more opportunities to fall. Avoid drinking within an hour of bedtime to reduce nocturnal bathroom trips. See a doctor if this doesn’t help, because going often at night can be a sign of a bladder, kidney, or prostate condition.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px;">
                        Limit caffeine throughout the day. A few cups of coffee a day is fine for most seniors, but having more than four can increase anxiety and blood pressure and interfere with sleep. Talk with a doctor about a <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-seniors-drinking-coffee-moderation-is-key/459"><u>safe amount of caffeine</u></a> for your loved one.

                    <b>3. Enlist a Professional Caregiver Trained in Fall Prevention</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professional Caregivers can bring an expert eye to a home to help eliminate falling hazards like those listed above—and to help ensure that your loved one is taking their prescribed medication correctly, exercising, etc. Seniors are often more receptive to lifestyle change suggestions from outside pros than from friends and family, seeing it more as expert advice than criticism. In addition to providing a safety assessment of the home, a professional caregiver’s regular visits can serve as reminders for activity—and in a worst-case scenario, another set of eyes checking in on your loved one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>4. Encourage Exercises That Improve Balance and Strength</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle weakness is the number one risk factor for falls, and balance and strengthening exercises are a simple and essential part of fall prevention. Check with a doctor or physical therapist before beginning any exercise program, but some great starting exercises to build strength, balance and flexibility include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standing tall with heels, hips, shoulders and head against the wall for a minute or two helps with posture and balance.</li>
                    <li>Standing tall (shoulders over hips over heels) with hands holding onto a countertop and lifting one knee at a time and then the other, as many times as possible, for two minutes. Once comfortable with this, lift and hold a knee for up to 30 seconds, repeating with the other leg</li>
                    <li>Walking in a straight line (use the lines of hardwood floors or tile to help) for a few steps forward, working up to greater distances and including walking backward</li>
                    <li>Purchasing a small pedal to sit in a chair and pedal for 10 minutes per day </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>5. Acknowledge the Mental and Emotional Strain of Falling</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fear of falling again is a common and often debilitating after-effect of a fall. Seniors begin avoiding walking (or holding onto walls for balance and looking at their feet) and any activity, both in the home and in social settings. This only exacerbates the risk factors for falls: Muscles get weaker, balance and flexibility rapidly decrease, and they can experience extreme loneliness and listlessness, emotional factors that make it significantly harder for them to be motivated to make improvements like exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the right support, your aging parent can recover from the physical and emotional injuries they sustained from a fall.
